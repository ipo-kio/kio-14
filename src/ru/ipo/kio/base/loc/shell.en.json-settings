			<p>While you are solving a problem the flash-program saves your best solution automatically 
			using memory provided by a flash-player. Amount of this memory is corrected during the first 
			launch of the task program. Some other programs on your computer, the ones that clean the 
			computer’s memory, can remove your temporary solutions. That’s why every time you finish 
			working on a problem you should save your solution by clicking on button Save Best 
			Solutions (and a questioner). After that the program will offer you to choose a folder 
			to store the file and to give a name to the file. This is the file that you need to send 
			to the CTE Organizing Committee  at the end of the competition via CTE site. 
			If you want to continue to solve the problems using another computer you need to 
			take this file with you and all necessary information won’t be lost. 

            CuandWhile solving the problems you may need to save an interim solution 
			and open it later for improving. You can make it by clicking on buttons
			that save and open one of the interim solutions. Clearing buttons can help 
			you to remove all the constructing elements from the work field.
